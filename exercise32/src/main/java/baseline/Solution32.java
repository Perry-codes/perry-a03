    Exercise 32 - Guess the Number Game

    Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game. The computer picks a random number in that range and
prompts the player to guess that number. Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the player a
hint as to whether the number is too high or too low. The computer should also keep track of the number of
guesses. Once the player guesses the correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses
and ask if the player would like to play again.

Constraints
• Don’t allow any non-numeric data entry.
• During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong guesses.
